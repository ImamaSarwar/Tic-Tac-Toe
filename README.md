# Tic-Tac-Toe
This is a console-based Tic Tac Toe game implemented in C++ at a Programming Fundamentals (PF) level. It enables two players to take turns playing on a standard 3x3 grid. The project focuses on practicing core programming concepts such as conditionals, loops, functions, and input validation, all while maintaining a simple and interactive gameplay experience.
## Gameplay Overview
- Two players alternate turns:
  - **Player 1** uses 'X'
  - **Player 2** uses 'O'
- Players select a position (1â€“9) to place their mark. If a player chooses an already occupied cell, an error message is displayed prompting them to try again.
- The first player to align three marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins.
- If all positions are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.
## Features
- Turn-based two-player mode
- Real-time input validation and feedback
- Clear and user-friendly board display
- Handles both win and draw scenarios accurately
